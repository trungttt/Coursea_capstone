    "## 1.\tDescription of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Being the capital of one of the most prosperity Scandinavian countries, Oslo is facing ever changing reforms and new challenges. One of which is in the food industry, it is quite hard for potential business owners to find a suitable location for their business. Because most of the central and desired locations have already been taken. In addition, the rental pricing in Oslo or in Norway as whole is quite expensive, meaning that the location plays even a bigger role than it already does. This leads to finding a suitable location is quite a demanding task. This applies both for a new location or taking over an established one. However, the challenge makes the task even more attracting. I will try to use as much location data to build a portfolio to find the best suited location for a new restaurant in Oslo. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.\t Discussion of the Background\n",
    "\n",
    "My client, who is a very great chef and an intelligent businessman. He already owes a restaurant in Oslo city center serving amazing food. His goal is to find better locations to expand his business into a chain restaurant within Oslo commune. Being the one with the experience in this business, he understands that the location among other factors plays one of the most significant roles in the successfulness of a restaurant.  \n",
    "These are the client’s requirements: They should be in the topmost populated boroughs in Oslo.  The population in those areas should be higher than 55.000 people. They should also be close to public transportation since Oslo is a green city. The locations should be located inside or closed to shopping centers or public parking lots. Are there many venues in the 1000-meter radius of these locations? The renting budget is not an issue. \n",
    "This is a personal-customer oriented project. However, given the scope of the projects, it could target a wide range of audience with different requirements because the criteria could be adjusted accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will rely on public data from 'citypopulation.de' website and Foursquare and google maps. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Information of Oslo boroughs and population can be obtained from 'citypopulation.de' to judge the location with the topmost populated boroughs.\n",
    "2. After the topmost populated boroughs have been identified, Foursquare will be utilized to find the venues within the 1000-meter radius around the center of each borough. These venues could be like cinemas or centers (shopping or fitness) or famous coffee shop or famous tourist attractions etc,. These should be the priorities to choose locations for restaurants. Because it will increase the visibility and attract more customers to the potential restaurants.\n",
    "3. After choosing the potential locations, I will use Geo-location data from Foursquare to see if there are public transportations around the locations. Because Oslo is a green city and there are many people who use public transportation here. \n",
    "4. Utilizing Foursquare to find out other restaurants, shopping events, nightlife events etc., in the 500-meter radius to find out what kinds of businesses are in the area and if there will any potential for restaurant concept\n",
    "5. Map with geo-location data will be generated with potential locations to be presented to the client. "

    "The list of boroughs and their corresponding population data has been obtained from [citypopulation.de](https://www.citypopulation.de/php/norway-oslocity.php). Then the Geo-location data was extracted for these different boroughs.The list of boroughs have been shorten down to the ones ((Frogner, Gamle Oslo, and Grunnerløka)) that has a population higher than 55000 people. \n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare was then utilized to explore each borough to find a potential location in each borough to open a restaurant (Gimle Kino, Arkehus Slott, and Tøyen Parken). By examining the list of the top 10 most common venues, we could see that:\n",
    "Frogner area has a \"Movie theater\" which is in the top 5 most common venues in this area, while all the top venues above it are mainly restaurants. \n",
    "Gamle Oslo has the \"Castle\" as a famous tourist attraction which is in the top 2 most common venue in this area with the top 1 is a scandanavian restaurant. \n",
    "Grünerløkka has a famous coffee shop which is top 1 most common venues in this area. These locations also fit in the requirement of the client. The list also shows us that there are many restaurants around these venues, which is showing a really good sign for business. Therefore I mainly focused on these venues as the primary locations to open the restaurants. \n",
    "\n",
    "After finding the target locations, Foursquare was then used again to explore different venues around these locations within 600-meter radius, which is around 5-7 minute walking distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many bus stops or cable car and metro stations within the above mention radius. This has met the client's requirement as Oslo is a green city and lots of people use public transportation. Hence, easily access to public transportation is a must. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many nightlife spots and food services around these locations showing that they are indeed the hot spots for restaurants in Oslo. If we were to open restaurants in these locations, we would have the visibility factor in our favors and a huge potential to attract more customers.  "

    "Purpose of this project was to find suitable locations to open a chain-restaurants in Oslo. Our analysis has been able to narrow down to 3 neighborhoods (Frogner, Gamle Oslo, and Grunnerløka) and three potential locations in these boroughs (Gimle Kino, Arkehus Slott, and Oslovelo) with many hot venues (Transportation, food services and night life spots) within a 600-meter radius. Hence, opening restaurants within this radius will be a good choice for business. However, the final decission on optimal restaurant locations will be made by stakeholders based on our results and other characteristics of each neighborhood."
